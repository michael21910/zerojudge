# ZeroJudge
My submissions on ZeroJudge.  
Since Java is new to me at this point, I will try my best to submit solutions using Java.  
Moreover, Python as well since I need more practice.  
Currently, I'm challenging myself to got 2 or more ACs everyday.  
  
Each problem always include Python solutions, sometimes Java.
